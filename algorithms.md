## Definition
Nothing scary - an algorithm is:
* A finite sequence of steps used to solve a problem.

### Every day examples of algorithms
- Cooking from a recipe
- Knitting a scarf from a pattern
- Sharpen the edge of an antler with a series of strikes from a peice of stone

### Computers and computation
- The most challenging tasks for a computer are things like talking to people, fixing corrupted files or winning GO
- These situations have one or more of the following in common:
    - The rules aren't clear
    - Some required information is missing
    - Finding exactly the right answer would require a considering a massive number of possible alternatives

_Tackling real-world tasks requires being comfortable with chance, trading off time with accuracy and using approximations_
