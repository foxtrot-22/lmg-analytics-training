## Example of small data
- Single data point!
- Can also be applied to situations such as arriving at a bus stop and asking when the last bus passed by
- Given we don't always have all the information we need...how to proceed?

### Solution
- Assume that there is nothing special about your taxi and that it was equally likely to be any taxi in the city
- If any taxi were equally likely then you are likely to be in the middle of the taxi range (50% before and 50% after)
- Unless you know any better you are likely to have shown up precisely halfway into the duration of any given phenomenon
- Therefore the best guess we can make for how long it will last into the future is exactly as long as something has taken in the past
- AKA the Copernican principle
- If you see a sign that says "7 days since the last industrial accident" you may want to steer clear
