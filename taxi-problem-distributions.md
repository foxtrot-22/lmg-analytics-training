## Variants
- If we apply this principle to a meeting a 90 year old man, we will predict he will live to 180, whilst a 6 year old will pass away at 12...
- Uniformative prior - no useful information about the taxis...
- Real world priors - applying what we know using distributions
    - Human life spans are roughly "normally" distributed (aka gaussian)
- This rule (Bayes rule) offers a simple but different predictive rule of thumb for each distribution
- Power-law = Multiplicative (Quantity observed by a constant)
    - for an uninformed prior constant = 2
    - movie ticket take constant = 1.4 (if a movie has made $6M you can guess it will make about $8.4M overall)
- Normal distribution = Average
    - If someone is younger than the average, predict the average
    - If someone is approaching the average or exceeding the average, add on a couple of years
- Erlang distribution = Additive
    - Useful for independent things, modelling networks, radioactive decay, pedestrian traffic
    - Predicts that things will go on for a constant amount longer
        - "Just five more minutes"
        - Playing blackjack with 20-1 odds - the player will be 20 more hands. If he/she hasn't won, they will be there for another 20 hands.
