## A quick story OR why this training is focused the way it is
- Asked to introduce predictive maintenance at Wolf Blass wastewater treatment plant
    - ~3rd biggest winery in Australia after Karadoc (Lindemans) and Berri
    - ~70,000 crush tonnes & 25M 9LEs produced
- Predictive maintenance relies on solid process engineering, sensors in equipment (e.g. temperature, rotation, humidity) and modern approaches such as IOT to transmit data in near-real time for analysis
