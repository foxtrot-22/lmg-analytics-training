## House Hunting
- Imagine you are looking for an apartment in just the right location - handy to work, schools, public transport, buzzy nightlife etc.
- The market is savage, opens are often held but the property is given to a "friend" of the owner, prices are going up and properties seem to disappear before you've even called about them.
- Such a market leaves little room for deliberate fact-finding and research, endless hours spent choosing the best place on realestate.com.au...
- When you do attend an open house, you can commit to the apartment or you can walk away never to return.
- Your goal is reducing the regrets of "the one that got away" and the "stone left unturned" to the minimum.
- How are you to know that an apartment is indeed the best unless you have some baseline? How can you establish that baseline unless you look at (and lose) a lot of apartments?
** The more information you gather, the better you'll know the right place when you see it - but the more likely you are to have already passed it by...
