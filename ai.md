## Myths
- Most so-called AI is "weak" and the market is incredibly over-hyped
- Do not believe everything you hear. There is a reason that the same examples get trotted out in the media (e.g. father realising his daughter was pregnant when he received a gift voucher for nappies from target)
- There is no "magic" - machines are still dumb, but can be trained
- Some terms which are advanced statistics have been bundled under the banner "AI"
- Some of these techniques have been around for many years, in such fields as operations research
