## Analytics as a way of thinking
- Analytics is less about tooling and more about thinking in different ways
- Effectively you are:
    - Discovering "problems"
    - Determining if there is business value in a solution to the "problem"
    - Attempting to solve the "problem"
    - Creating a useful insight, tool or report which influences or changes behaviour ("actionable insight")
- There is little to no point in solving problems that do not have a clearly defined business value (although its OK to do this to satisfy your own curiosity on your own time :-)

## Approaches to improving
- Puzzle based learning
    - Encourages people to think about how to frame or approach problems
- Experimentation
    - With techniques
    - With tools
    - With different data sets

## Structured approach
- Understand what is being asked for
- Devise a plan (respond to what is asked for)
- Carry out the plan (Develop the result of the response)
- Looking back (Checking what does the result tell me)
