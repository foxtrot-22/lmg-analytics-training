## Definitions
- Outlier
    - Legitimate data point that far away from the other observations
    - Things that lie outside normal experience
- Anomaly
    - Illegitimate data point generated by a different process
### Notes
- Sometimes these terms are used interchangably...
- There is no rigid definition of what constitutes an outlier...

### Why they are important
a. If you take the daily returns of the stockmarket from 1900 to 2018 and you subtract the 10 best days, how much less money would you have?
b. If you subtract the 10 worst days, how much more money would you have?

## Main causes
- Data errors
    - Human error
    - Data collection or recording
    - Data entry
- Intentional or motivated mis-reporting
    - e.g making yourself look better on a survey or census
    - Deliberate for sensitive data
- Sampling error
    - Too few samples for a particular category etc.
- Standardisation Failure
    - Something anomalous happens during a subjects experience (e.g. Pandemic)
- Fault distribution assumptions

### Outliers as a focus
- We don't necessarily need to remove them. Sometimes finding them is the whole point! e.g. fraud identification
