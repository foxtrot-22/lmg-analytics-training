### Exercise
You are given a rectangular block of chocolate which is divided into smaller rectangles (like the previous picture). You need to break the chocolate bar into as many peices as possible (that is if you have a bar with 4 peices like the smaller one in the previous picture, you'd break it once to get 2*2 then once again for each smaller peice for a total of 3 breaks). How should you break any chocolate bar using the minimum number of steps (breaks)?
