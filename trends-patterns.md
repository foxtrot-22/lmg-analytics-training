## What are trends and patterns
- A pattern is a repetition of something similar
- A trend is a generalised pattern

- Therefore when we identify patterns we are generally identifying a trend and stating the pattern as a generalisation
- We use words such as most, all, decreasing, increasing, staying the same, seasonal, fluctuating etc
- Patterns show how something is distributed...that is, where something is placed.

## Pattern types
- Clustered or concentrated
    - Look for the cause "what could be causing sales in this area to change?"
    - Why are all dairy farms concentrated in this area?
    - Why are there so many bottle shops in that suburb?
- Sparse
    - Spread out observations - "What could be causing so few people to buy this beer?"
- Linear
- Peripheral
    - Located around the outside, or on the edge
- Regular
- Irregular/Random
