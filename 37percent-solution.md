Spend 37% of you apartment hunt (11 days if you gave yourself a month), noncommitally exploring options. Don't even think about purchasing.
After that point, immediately commit to the very first place you see that beats everything else you've seen...
### Rule
_Look then Leap_

- Imagine there are only 2 apartments - you have a 50% chance of choosing the right one
- With 3 apartments you have a 33% chance if selecting randomly
    - However, on the second interview you now have _information_
    - If you wait to the 3rd apartment you have no _agency_ you have to put in an offer
    - Best possible strategy is to commit to the 2nd apartment if it is better than the 1st
- As the pool of apartments grows, the exact place to draw the line between looking and leaping settles to 37% of the pool - look at the first 37% of the apartments (or do it by time) and be ready to leap!
